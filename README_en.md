# COVID19gr - Open Data aggregation and Knowledge Base repository for COVID-19 in Greece. 

Open Data aggregation repository for the evolution of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in Greece. The repository is being updated as the pandemic evolves.

## 1. Repository structure.

In this repository you will find:

### 1.1. Datasets

Available in machine readable format and frequently updated:
- [32 in .CSV format](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/tree/master/data/csv)
- [32 in .JSON format](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/tree/master/data/json)

_**NOTES:**_ 

- _The aforementioned datasets were created and are being maintained mainly by wither *** fellow citizens' initiatives *** who publish them under open data licenses and, of course, gratis free, or by organizations (research centres, private companies, etc.). Following you will find a detailed analysis of the data sources._
- _Daily data (i.e. cases, deaths, etc.) correspond to the time of announcement by the Greek Government and not to the time of the events. For more information we urge you to check the details of the creator of the datasets (see below)._

3. The periodic reporting of the measures compliance checks by the National Transparency Agency of Greece in .html format.
4. The periodic indexing of the news about the evolution of the pandemic from the blog of Clipnews S.A.

The above sources are aggregated, as hyperlinks, in a spreadsheet and are freely and openly available for use and editing in [.CSV] format (https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/blob/master/data/csv/covid19_reports.csv), [.JSON](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/blob/master/data/json/covid19_reports.json) and [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11A17Sb8pk9NyXz2FvRzaZIkxxNfiZcxUDBjjVkbXNQk/edit?usp=sharing) (read only)

_**NOTES:**_

- _Many data sets are a product of a combination of different primary data sources. We suggest for the best possible use that the intended user refer to the data sources provided below, in terms of how each dataset was created._
- _References in .pdf format from 17/12/2020 are no longer available to keep the size of the repository low._

### 1.6. Unified Open Data Schema

One of the main purposes of this repository is the aggregation of open data from various sources and volunteers. For a combined and effective study it is necessary to create a data schema that can clarify the data of each dataset and help the user to better understand these data. Following you will find the unified data schema and a free online tool that will allow you to access it in a simpler, visual format.
